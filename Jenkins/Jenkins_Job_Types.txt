
Job/Project Types
==================

Freestyle Project :- 
	This is the most "common type" pf project. The build step for this
	type of project normally executes a shell (Linux) or batch
	(Windows) command. 


Pipeline:

	This type of project used to be called a "workflow". These projects
	are normally written in Jenkins Domain Specific Language (DSL).
	
	These types of projects are for things that do not fit in a freestyle
	project, because they are too complicated or span multiple nodes.


Multi-Configuration Project:

	This is for projects that will be tested on "multiple environments", and
	require different configurations, depending on those environments.


Git-Hub Organization:

	This type of project can use the "source control platform's organization" and
	allow Jenkins to act on Jenkinsfiles stored within the organization’s
	repositories.


Folder:
	This provides a method to group projects together. This is not technically a
	project. It acts as a type of directory structure for the projects, and the folder
	name becomes part of the path of the projects.


Multi-Branch Pipeline:
	In this type of project, Jenkins uses a "Jenkinsfile to mark repositories". If a
	branch is created in that repository, Jenkins will make a new project in Jenkins
	for that branch.

Job / Project Scope:

	This includes all of the items that are part of that particular Job / Project. In
	some cases, there are Global libraries that are brought into the scope of a
	project simply by being included. Other items that are declared within a
	project only exist in that project’s scope, and are not available as a shared
	resource.
